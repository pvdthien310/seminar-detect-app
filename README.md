## About The Project
  Google's 2017 article titled "Attention is all you need" about Transformers really created a huge turning point in the field of natural language processing (NLP). Back in the non-transformer era, the processing of input sentences of RNNs had to take place sequentially, leading to its slow processing speed and the long-distance dependence being limited to a single sentence or a single sentence. paragraph. Now, when Google introduces Transformer, the other basic problems and limitations have also been improved and fixed. There are many reasons for choosing Transformer architecture for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) problem. Some of the main reasons include:High Performance: The Transformer architecture is considered one of the best neural network architectures available today in terms of performance and accuracy. It can help you recognize handwriting or print more accurately than other architectures. - Different length handling: Transformer architecture can handle different data set length flexibly and efficiently, which can make handwriting or print recognition uniform and accurate. Scalability: The Transformer architecture can be extended to support new features or other complex problems, which can help improve system performance and accuracy.

  The goal of choosing the Transformer architecture for the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) problem is to improve the performance and accuracy of the print recognition system (in this seminar). The Transformer architecture is considered one of the best neural network architectures available today in terms of performance and accuracy. It can handle different dataset lengths flexibly and efficiently, and can handle both images and text well.Choosing the Transformer architecture for the OCR problem will result in more uniform and accurate print recognition, and provide scalability to support new features or other complex problems in the future. . We believe that choosing Transformer architecture for OCR problem will help us achieve our goal of learning new tools and technologies in the field of NLP that can improve system performance and accuracy. print recognition.
